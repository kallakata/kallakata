Hi, I’m **@kallakata**!



I currently work as a **Platform Engineer** at **@Veeam** with a keen interest in cybersecurity, penetration testing, observability/monitoring, Infrastracture-as-Code, and overall virtually anything related to managing infrastructure and large-scale automation. I also try to embed security mindset into whole process.

As of now, my primary focus is SRE & DevOps, especially from platform engineering standpoint when managing dozens of environments reliably and securely is necessary. Predominantly in Azure using Terraform and Golang. Apart from my regular tech stack, I am broadening my knowledge in **C#/.NET** in Azure ecosystem, on-premise automation and **Pulumi**.

Despite trying to understand the layers below the abstractions, my passion is aimed at cloud computing (_AWS, GCP & Azure_), distributed systems (_Kubernetes & orchestration_), infrastructure management (_Terraform & Pulumi_) and cloud-native applications along with their respective philosophy.

This drove me to learn _Golang_, dabble in _Rust_ and play with distributed tracing, all of which I use to build APIs and highly available, decoupled microservices along with internal tools for everyday use. I also try to embrace SRE principles, best practices, and support/contribute to meaningful open-source initiatives.

These days, my go-to languages in no particular order are usually:
* **Go**
* **Python**
* **C#**

Lately, I have been dabbling in LLMs, MCPs, agents and various local machine learning models, as well as the surrounding ecosystem around it.
